Serial number naming logic:
X.X.X (ex: 1.2.1)
-first X only change annually upon new generation when all/most AI models contained in the app receives overhaul, or when track used is changed so that backward compatibility is completely eliminated.
-second X change when a. algorithm for result computation is tweaked in any way
		      b. method for spectrogram generation is changed in any way
		      c. new product line is added
		      d. some existing models have been retrained for adjustment reasons
		      e. threshold line is altered
		      f. app fundamental logic has changed
		      g. app UI receives major update
-third X change when some fixing some bugs or update some small features.


V1.1
-Change the spectrogram generation method from matplotlib.specgram to more stable Librosa library.
-Change the range of difference calculation in frequency from 20kHz down to 14kHz to improve result sensitivity
-Unified the difference calculation, now time domain data are also calculated by averaging the absolute differences, and the calculation are done after the by-row normalization on frequency. It matches the method of calculation just like frequency difference.
-Add the x-axis location data in the output raw data file.
-Add the feature to output the overall raw data graph when outputting raw data, now 4 png image will be generated along with the original 4 csv files.
-Add a column that indicate the fail/pass status of each file in the output report.

V1.2
-Sort the list before calculation so that both in-app DUT selection list and the output report is sorted.
-Added dumb-proof that disable AI model dropdown to prevent user from switching the AI model when the scanning mode is on.
-Added dumb-proof that disable folder selection button to prevent user from selecting other folders when scanning mode is on.
-Added a new tab to cover all license and ensure no legal copyright issue.
-Adjusted the tab button color to make the selected tab more visible

V1.2.1
-Added a reset button that can clear all the existing result in the app.
-Change the way license notices are shown to add difficulty for users to guess the modules used in the app.
-Change the way windows system bring up the app to increase the clarity of the app content.
-Change the app icon from default tkinter app icon to HP logo.
-Some UI layout optimization.
-Some code optimization

V1.3
-Made x-axis label of the frequency plot denser for more readable graph.
-Added a capability to automatically pad background noise into the audio file when input file is too short.
-Changed Training Optimizer and re-trained all model to slightly increase the flexibility of models.

V1.3.1
-Added a password button to ensure OP can't easily alter the result, password is 640320.
-Re-training the 1000 series model to resolve the Gemtree piano deviation problem. (More test is still needed)
-Added AIO Model for test purpose only (Training sets too small, might be unreliable)

V1.4
-Optimize existing code to reduce I/O access counts and reduce complexity
-Shrink and optimize model size without hurting performance. (more test need to be carried out)
-Enhance overall model accuracy with data augmentation
-Hide occasional pop-up warnings in consoles when analyzing to reduce app content disclosure.
-Further improved model reliability on Gemtree
-Added splash screen when the app boots.
-Fix the frequency graph in output raw data button

V1.4.1
-Changed the output report and output raw data function to automatically execute after every iteration, deleting their output button.
-Changed the way the output report display to include date and keep only SN numbers in name.
-Changed the scanning mode logic to eliminate a bug that makes scanning mode turning off later than the GUI indicates, also optimized the logic to make it less prone to lag
-Added a condition in scanning mode to fix a bug that can freeze the app.
-Add a exception fail-safe when accessing audio track in folder, eliminate the risk of failing by access denied.
-Optimize the code structure to unify the plotting logic
-Optimize the code structure for ease of future updates (The rest are completed in version 1.4.2)

V1.4.2 (Test version, update content not finalized)
-Added the feature to playback the music track. (Done)
-Added an error safe feature that notify the user to close the report file before it try to write them. (Done)
-Changed underlying structure of the app. (Done)
-Changed the frequency domain range from 870Hz~14000Hz to 2000Hz~14000Hz. (Function completed, change not finalized)
-Ignore the edges of piano spectrogram when evaluating result to improve result consistency (Done)
-Create an update-checking function that can tell the user if they are using the newest version. This function utilizes GitHub to maintain, need to add this to Document. (Done)

V1.5 and beyond (Planning)
-Added new AIO model. (official version will handover to let Danny do it)
-Add new variant of app that simplifies the app UI (Planning)
-Dealing with 16 bit-PCM resolution issue (solution still under planning)
